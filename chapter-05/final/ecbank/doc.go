/*
Package ecbank exposes an API to retrieve an exchange rate from a source to a target currency by calling an external API,
here the European Central Bank (ecb).
For example from USD to EUR, it will give the current exchange rate for the day 1.55.

The host is part of the main in the configuration, and you can change the path to access it within the package.
