- Common points :
  - Use "we" over "you"
  - 
    
- Clearly write the expectations (bullet points) at the beginning of each chapter
  - "In this chapter, we will see/learn how to ..."

- Write a nice funny intro with random trivia for each chapter 

- Throughout the code
  - Do not include `import` blocks in code (except when using Third Party Libraries)
  - Avoid acronyms
  - Justify why we need to write a line of code
  - Justify the choice of a basic tool (map, slice, channel, routines)

- A section should
  - Reflect the commits to show evolution
  - Have a "Let's test": each commit should be tested (and documented)
  - "Let's run the test" : once per chapter => overkill ?

- Open the conclusion with steps to go further
  - bullet points for exercises

- Write a summary of the chapter at the end - bullet points on "what you learned"
